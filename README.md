# Implementation of some common machine learning algorithms

Implementation of various common machine learning algorithms from scratch in python using various python libraries.

## Prerequisites

Python libraries : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow,nlp. 

## Usage

Install required libraries , download the repo. and make changes in file such as path to the dataset . To use the code use template file, put the template file inside the same folder as the dataset and create a main file then use #include template. 

## Results
Plots of dataset and decision boundary(wherever needed) are included inside the folder, additionally accuracies are present in the codeblocks

## Data
This project utilizes datasets provided in the COL774 and CS229 course assignment and . You can find the original datasets here[https://cs229.stanford.edu/summer2020/] & [https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/teaching/2023/col774/]

## Reproducibility

This project primarily uses Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. However, if you are using another programming language, you can use any libraries with graphing capabilities and data manipulation functions to achieve similar results. The code is well written with comments to make it easy to reproduce in any other language

# Implementation of some common machine learning algorithms

Implementation of various common machine learning algorithms from scratch in python using pandas and numpy.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

Python libraries : pandas, numpy, matplotlib. 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Data
This project utilizes datasets provided in the COL774 and CS229 course assignment and . You can find the original datasets here[https://cs229.stanford.edu/summer2020/] & [https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/teaching/2023/col774/]

## Reproducibility

This project primarily uses Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. However, if you are using another programming language, you can use any libraries with graphing capabilities and data manipulation functions to achieve similar results. The code is well written with comments to make it easy to reproduce in any other language
